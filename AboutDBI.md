# DBI
Distance Between Intervals (DBI) was introduced in Lo Valvo et al. (in press).

This pairwise distance works with continuous variables coded as intervals, whether they are groups of or single observations. DBI does not require summarizing the information in one value as classic distances do (e.g., Manhattan and Euclidean distances) reducing the loss of information. DBI also captures the complex overlap/non-overlap scenarios that could be given by a pair of intervals.

Here you will find DBI's application for R (DBIfunction.R) and the supplementary material to run the examples from Lo Valvo et al. (in press).
